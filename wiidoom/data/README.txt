WiiDoom 0.4.5
by Arikado ( http://arikadosblog.blogspot.com )

Source Code: http://code.google.com/p/wiidoom

-- Introduction --
WiiDoom is a DOOM port based on PrBoom. It is compatible with all versions of DOOM, DOOM II, and Final DOOM. 
There is an issue with using FreeDoom, so for now, only the official Doom releases are supported.


-- IMPORTANT INFO --
This is an BETA. That means there may be bugs in it. Please report them via this site:
http://wiidoom.googlecode.com


-- Requirements --
* A Wii
* Wii remote and Nunchuk
* This package
* Some method of booting Wii homebrew (i.e. Homebrew Channel)
* Doom 1/2/Final WAD file (shareware or commercial)


-- Instructions --
Homebrew Browser is the preferred method of installing WiiDoom.

Homebrew Channel: Copy the WiiDoom directory (inside the apps directory) into the "apps" folder of your SD card. 

Copy any Doom WAD files (doom.wad, doom2.wad, etc..) into the /apps/wiidoom/data/ directory. 
If you don't have a commercial version of Doom, go to the Source Code site to download the shareware version. 
Leave the prboom.wad file in the directory.
Copy any pwads (add-on levels) into the pwads directory, which is inside the /apps/wiidoom/data/ directory.

The Wad Loader runs first, allowing you to select the version of doom (IWAD) and any (optional) add-on levels (PWads). 
Select at least the IWAD and the start button will appear. Select Start and Doom loads up.


-- PWAD usage --
Multiple pwads are supported, using the same logic as the original Doom engine. 
The order you select them in the Wad Loader will be the exact order they're sent to the engine. 
Check the add-on level's instructions to determine if any special order is needed. 
WiiDoom only looks at the .wad files in the pwads directory, so you can store the .txt files that accompany the PWADs in the same directory.
